            Elile’s monitoring and alerting solutions provide real-time insights
            into operational parameters, helping maintain large-scale power
            production and distribution infrastructure. We continuously monitor
            KPIs and system metrics with advanced algorithms, and digital twins
            that simulate the physical systems in a virtual environment,
            providing a comprehensive view of system health. Our centralized
            dashboards offer full transparency, while predictive maintenance
            models pre-emptively identify potential equipment failures,
            optimizing maintenance schedules to reduce unplanned downtimes.
